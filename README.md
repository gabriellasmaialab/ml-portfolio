# 🧠 Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio!

I'm Gabriella and I hope you enjoy your time with me in this repository. 

This repository showcases practical machine learning projects built with Python, focusing on both foundational algorithms and real-world applications.

Each project includes:
- A clear problem statement
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Model implementation and evaluation
- Visualizations and insights
